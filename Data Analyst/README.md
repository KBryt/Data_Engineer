## Ever wondered what the main differences are between Power BI and Tableau? ü§î

Let's dive deep into the two data visualization giants! üåü

Here are the top 10 differences to help you decide which tool is the best fit for your needs (courtesy of Avijeet Biswal and Simplilearn) üëá

‚û°Ô∏èOwnership and Pricing: Power BI is a Microsoft product licensed on a per-user basis, while Tableau is owned by Salesforce and licensed on a per-user or per-server basis. Power BI offers a more affordable pricing structure, with a free version and lower-cost paid options. Tableau, on the other hand, can be more expensive, especially for enterprise-level solutions.

‚û°Ô∏èUser Interface: Tableau has a more user-friendly and intuitive interface, with drag-and-drop functionality and easier-to-use visuals. Power BI can take a bit more time to learn but provides more robust functionality for advanced users.

‚û°Ô∏èData Integration: Power BI is more tightly integrated with Microsoft products, such as Excel and SQL Server, whereas Tableau can connect to a wider range of data sources, including cloud-based databases and web services.

‚û°Ô∏èData Modeling: Power BI has more robust data modeling and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) capabilities than Tableau, making it a better choice for data manipulation and analysis.

‚û°Ô∏èCustomization: Tableau provides more advanced customization options for dashboards and visualizations, whereas Power BI is more limited in this regard.

‚û°Ô∏èCollaboration: Power BI has more collaboration features built-in, such as co-authoring and commenting, whereas Tableau requires third-party tools to achieve similar functionality.

‚û°Ô∏èMobile App: Power BI has a more robust mobile app for iOS and Android devices, while Tableau's mobile app is more limited in functionality.
