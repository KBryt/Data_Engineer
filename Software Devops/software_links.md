I have compiled a list of some of the most common and important principles in software engineering and have also provided resources for each principle to help you get started.

## Principle 1: #Software Architecture

Learn the fundamentals of software architecture: e.g., the different types of architectures, their pros and cons, and how to choose the right one for your project.
